# Final Thoughts
So originaly this game was chosen out of a minor memory of nostalga. Upon actually playing it the rose tinted glasses vanished and i was left wondering: How did i even play this as a 6 year old. A side from that it was a bit enjoyable to play. Going back a using the avaible cheats makes it more entertainning when everything is Fat.
