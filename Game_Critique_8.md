# Game Play Summary
Time Crisis is a three-dimensional first person rail shooter similar to Virtua Cop and The House of the Dead, in that the player holds a light gun and fires at on-screen enemies. Time Crisis is best known for its cover system, in which players can duck behind cover to avoid enemy fire and reload their weapons. In the arcade version, a foot pedal is used to toggle between ducking and attacking positions. In console conversions, a button command replicates the foot pedal's functions. The player loses a life if hit by a direct bullet or obstacle whilst not taking cover. There are three stages, each consisting of three areas and a boss battle.

The arcade cabinet's light gun (introduced in Point Blank) utilizes a special memory chip to synchronize areas of the screen's image as the player rotates the gun around. The light gun also features a blowback function which simulates real-life gun recoil.

The player must complete each area in a certain amount of time. To avoid running down the clock, the player must take risks, shooting enemies rapidly and hiding only when necessary. A time extension is rewarded when an area is passed, and there are time bonuses awarded for shooting certain enemies quickly.

The PlayStation port features an exclusive side-story mode, in which the player's performance, such as how quickly he can clear an area, affects the path he takes through the game, resulting in multiple possibilities.

# Final Thoughts
My personal thoughts I can't help but play this game or any of its sequels when i see them in an arcade. Its a game that tests how accurately you can aim and react. Well as long as the gun attachment is working properly aside from that the timing one must have when getting in an out of cover to avoid damage gives good a challenge. All in all this is one of the few fps games I'll actually play.
