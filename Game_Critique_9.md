# Synopsis
Kingdom Hearts Ï‡ is a prequel to the Kingdom Hearts series as a whole, taking place more than 100 years prior. It takes place before the Keyblade War, which established the organization of the Kingdom Hearts universe as of the original game. The player assumes the role of a Keyblade wielder who joins one of five factions led by Keyblade Masters fighting for control of the limited light existing in the world.

# Game Play Summary
## Playability
### Single/Multiplayer
single with a multiplayer feature called union cross where you play in real time with up to 5 other users of the app.
### Controls

# Bugs
There are times where you may complete a quest/mission in the union cross mode and it wont trigger the ending sequence and you'll be trapped in that level untill you quit.
# Final Thoughts
This is a casual yet appealing game to those that are fans of the Kingdom Hearts franchise as it is not merely a spin-off. This games story will eventually connect to the next Kingdom Hearts game KH3 meaning most things that happen here are part of the cannonical story. I find it to be a decent game to play as long as you arent bothered too by the pay to sort of win system known as jewels.
